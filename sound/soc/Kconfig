	  If you want ASoC support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your SoC platform below.
	  
	  ASoC provides power efficient ALSA support for embedded battery powered
	  SoC based systems like PDA's, Phones and Personal Media Players.

	  This ASoC audio support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called snd-soc-core.
